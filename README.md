## Final result
Two PID controllers, one for steering and one for throttle, were built. The final PID gains for steering controller are [0.1 0.0 2.5], and the PID gains for throttle are [0.3 0.0 0.02]. A short video demonstrates the performance.[demo_vedio\final_pid.mp4](demo_vedio\final_pid.mp4)

## Tuning of PID gains
### Effect of each components
* The P controller tries to steer the car toward the center line (against the cross-track error). If P gain is too large, the car overshoots the central line very easily and go out of the road very quickly, however, if P gain is too small, then the car can not steer quickly enough to go through the curves.
* The I controller tries to eliminate a possible bias on the controlled system that could prevent the error to be eliminated. In the case of the simulator, no bias is present, so the final I gain is very small
* The D controller helps to counteract the proportional trend to overshoot the center line by smoothing the approach to it.

### Tuning of parameters
The parameters were chosen manually by try and error. I first add the P controller to make the car following the road, but it starts overshooting went off road quickly. Then I added the D controller to try to overcome the overshooting. The I controller only moved the car out of the road, so I remove the I controller by making I gain zero. After the car drove the track without going out of it, I tweak the parameters little by little based on feeling, i.e. tuning P gain based on overshoot, and D gain accordingly to P gain.

I also implemented a PID controller for the throttle, to maximize the car's speed around the track. The throttle PID controller is fed the magnitude of the CTE because if the car went off center no matter left or right we need to decrease throttle a little bit to allow the car to drive slower to go back to center. For this reason the throttle controller doesn't include an I component, which would only grow indefinitely. The target thorttle was set to 0.75 giving about 60 mph, and I set the range to be [0.01 1.0].

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
